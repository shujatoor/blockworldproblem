# blockworldproblem
I have tried to solve the project given on this link: https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/summer-2021/mini-project-2/
An agent that can solve Block World problems for an arbitrary initial arrangement of blocks. 
You can give an initial arrangement of blocks and a goal arrangement of blocks, and return a list of moves that will transform the initial state into the goal state.
Run the main_blockworld.py file.
You can change the initial order of the blocks in the main_blockworld.py file (using the variable initial)
