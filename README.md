# blockworldproblem
I have tried to solve the project given on this link: https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/summer-2021/mini-project-2/
Please read the pdf file 'Mini-Project 2_Block World' in the master branch. Its the detailed report on the code
An agent that can solve Block World problems for an arbitrary initial arrangement of blocks. 
You can give an initial arrangement of blocks and a goal arrangement of blocks, and return a list of moves that will transform the initial state into the goal state.
Run the main_blockworld.py file.
You can change the initial order of the blocks in the main_blockworld.py file (using the variable initial)
